BlockyText
======

This program takes figlet into the modern, unicode, html era.

All the latest hipster technologies are used here, like bootstrap, jquery, php, um ... style sheets that cascade, expression that are quite regular, the figlet fonts ...

The source code is here, for those that like that kind of thing. Not me thought, I've had enough of this.

Bye.
